# Coding Standards

- YAGNI: Don't build features that aren't needed yet
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself — but don't prematurely abstract either. Three similar lines beat a wrong abstraction.
- Minimal changes: Only modify what's needed for the current task
- No gold-plating: Don't improve, refactor, or clean up adjacent code unless explicitly asked
- Commit frequently: Small, focused commits with clear messages
- Follow existing patterns: Match the codebase's existing style, naming, and structure
- No over-engineering: Simple solutions beat clever solutions
- Error handling: Handle errors at system boundaries. Trust internal code and framework guarantees.
- Comments: Only where the logic isn't self-evident. Don't add docstrings to code you didn't write.

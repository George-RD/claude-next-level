# Verification Before Completion

- Never claim work is "done", "complete", or "finished" without running the test suite
- Show actual test output — don't just say "tests pass"
- If tests fail, fix them before claiming completion
- Evidence before assertions: run the command, show the output, THEN state the conclusion
- "I believe the tests pass" is not evidence — "Tests: 12 passed, 0 failed" is
- Run the FULL test suite, not just the new tests
- Check for regressions: existing tests must still pass
- If there's a linter configured, run it too

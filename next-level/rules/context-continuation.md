# Context Continuation

- Monitor your context usage throughout the session
- At 80%: Start wrapping up your current subtask — finish what you're doing, don't start new work
- At 90%: Write handoff notes to ~/.next-level/sessions/{session}/continuation.md:
  - Current task and progress
  - What's done and what's remaining
  - Next steps in priority order
  - Any blockers or decisions needed
  - File paths that are relevant
- At 95%: Stop immediately — do not start any new work
- When starting a fresh session, check for continuation files FIRST
- If continuation.md exists, read it and resume from where the previous session left off
- Don't restart work that was already completed in a previous session
